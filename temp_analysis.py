HIT137 Assignment 2 - Question 2
Australian Weather Stations Temperature Analysis


This program analyzes temperature data of multiple Australian weather stations from the 'temperature_data' folder across different years.
It performs the following tasks:
1. Calculates average temperatures for each season across all years
2. Identifies stations with the largest temperature range
3. Determines the warmest and coolest stations

Output files:
- average_temp.txt: Contains seasonal average temperatures
- largest_temp_range_station.txt: Lists stations with the largest temperature variation
- warmest_and_coolest_station.txt: Details about the warmest and coolest stations
